This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.4.


## Installation

### First Step

Before you install Angular in your system, you should have Node and npm in your system. 
You can use the Node Version Manager to install it, or you can use the official package manager of your OS. 
You also have the option to install Node from its website. 
We recommend installing it from the website as it’s quick and straightforward. 
You’d only have to head to the download page of node.js. 
`https://nodejs.org/en/download/`

### Second Step

To check if Node is installed in your device or not, open the command prompt and run the following command: 
`$ node -v`
It would show the currently installed version of Node in your system. 

### Third Step

After checking if you have Node installed in your system, you can install Angular in your device by running the command prompt’s following command:
`$ npm install @angular/cli`
After running the command above, Angular CLI will install in your device. You have completed the ‘how to install Angular’ part. 

### Fourth Step

We also used Firebase and some community-made Angular materials. You also have to install those packages.

`$ npm install @angular/material`
`$ npm install @angular/fire`
`$ npm install tslib`
`$ npm install ng-image-slider --save`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
